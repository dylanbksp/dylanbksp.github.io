<h1>Writing Systems</h1>

<p>Bosnian utilizes two writing systems, the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet. Although Bosnian is mainly
    written in Latin, it is still best to be familiar with both alphabets, as there will likely be many documents and
    texts that you will need to read that are written in Cyrillic. In terms of the Latin alphabet, you should pay close
    attention to the unique letters <em>č</em>, <em>ć</em>, <em>dž</em>, <em>đ</em>, <em>lj</em>, <em>nj</em>, <em>š</em>,
    and <em>ž</em>. Additionally, pay attention to the vowels and the letters <em>c</em> and <em>r</em>, as they make
    different sounds than in English.
