    IPA stands for the International Phonetic Alphabet, a standardized method of transcribing all sounds 
    that are used in any natural language. I recommend using 
    <a href="https://www.ipachart.com/" target="_blank">www.ipachart.com</a> for quickly hearing what a symbol sounds
    like, and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" target="_blank">its 
    Wikipedia page</a> for deeper information.

<p>
    Unfortunately, /a/ never appears in English outside of dipthongs. The letter a in <em>alpha</em> represents /æ/, while 
    the letter a in <em>father</em> represents /ɑ/. However, /a/ can be seen in words such as <em>mouth</em> and 
    <em>price</em>, representing /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ respectively. /æ/ in <em>alpha</em> is a close enough approximation though. 
    You can find out more about /a/

export const IPA_R_EXPLANATION : string = `
<p>
    Unfortunately, /ɾ/ never appears in English. This symbol represents the tapped r, which is notably present in 
    common languages such as Spanish. A common approximation used to teach English speakers the tapped r is by saying 
    <em>better</em> or <em>butter</em> quickly, as the t sound shares the same place of articulation as the tapped r.
